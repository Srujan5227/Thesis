## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project investigates the effectiveness, transparency, and fairness of machine learning modelsâ€”particularly LightGBMâ€”compared to traditional logistic regression in predicting credit card default. It uses SHAP for interpretability and includes a fairness audit across income and geography.

##  Contents
- `Project_1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all experiments, results, and plots.

##  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn, LightGBM, pandas, SHAP, matplotlib, etc.

## How to Run
Open the notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
