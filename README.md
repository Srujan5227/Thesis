**Author:** Srujan Bombay  
**Program:** MSc in Data Science  
**University:** GISMA University of Applied Sciences  

## 📄 Overview
This project investigates the effectiveness, transparency, and fairness of machine learning models—particularly LightGBM—compared to traditional logistic regression in predicting credit card default. It uses SHAP for interpretability and includes a fairness audit across income and geography.

## 📁 Contents
- `Project_1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all experiments, results, and plots.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn, LightGBM, pandas, SHAP, matplotlib, etc.

## 📂 How to Run
Open the notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
